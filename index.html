                outdoors (often on private and pristine Scout owned reservations) or

                <u>You can still be a Scout</u>! All of our Scouts go to school and most
                participate in other activities during their Scouting career, like club
                or school sports, marching band or take lessons for things like music or
                martial arts. <em>If they can do it, you can do it too!</em> We
                understand that Scouts may miss meetings or camp outs, or come late or
                leave early. When you think about it, youth will often spend a full 7
                years in Scouting. We take this long term view, because we know that
                Scouting will be there though the ebb and flow of their other
                activities, providing a solid foundation to learn and grow from. Few
                things are as beneficial, accommodating or keep youth engaged for as
                long as Scouting.
